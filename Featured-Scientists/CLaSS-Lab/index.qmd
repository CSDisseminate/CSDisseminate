The Children’s Literacy and Speech Sound (CLaSS) Lab has a mission to help children with speech and language impairments achieve classroom success. We work towards this goal in two related lines of work. One has examined how working memory, language, and orthography may influence children's abilities to learn new words, read, and achieve age-appropriate speech production. A related line of work has examined how speech therapy-level variables, such as SLPs' stress, job satisfaction, therapy quality, and IEP goals, may impact the outcomes seen in children with speech and language impairments.
