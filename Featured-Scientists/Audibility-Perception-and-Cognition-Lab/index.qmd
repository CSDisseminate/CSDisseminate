PI: Ryan McCreery, PhD

Ryan McCreery, PhD, is the Director of Research and Audiology at Boys Town National Research Hospital. He is a hearing scientist dedicated to improving the developmental outcomes of children who are hard of hearing. He directs the [Audibility, Perception, and Cognition laboratory](https://www.boystownhospital.org/research/hearing-speech-perception/audibility-perception-cognition), where we explore how children's auditory, linguistic, and cognitive skills impact their ability to understand speech in complex listening environments. His current research projects focus on developing ways to improve the ways we test children’s hearing, and fit hearing aids for children who are hard of hearing.\
