We are currently fundraising to cover basic operating costs for 2026-2029, enabling our work to remain free and publicly available.

### Where your donation goes

Your support helps cover:

-   Our annual website domain and hosting (\~\$47)

-   A Canva subscription used to create accessible, shareable educational materials (\~\$120)

-   Transaction and platform fees associated with fundraising

Our goal is **\$500**, which covers these costs and a small buffer for fees.

No funds are used to pay ourselves. CSDisseminate is entirely volunteer-driven. Every dollar supports the infrastructure that allows us to share resources, host initiatives, and build community around open science.
