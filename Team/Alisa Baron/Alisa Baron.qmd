Her research focuses on how children process speech and language and how this may differ in monolingual and bilingual children with and without developmental disorders (developmental language disorder (DLD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)). Alisa uses behavioral measures, along with eye tracking, electroencephalography (EEG), and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technologies to identify differences that may not be detectable behaviorally."
