    "text": "Hello, world!\nWe‚Äôve got some exciting news: OpenCSD and CSDisseminate are joining forces and becoming one working group! Our mission is still the same: to spread the word about open science in communication sciences and disorders (CSD). But now we‚Äôre doing it together.\n\nWhy the merge?\nCSDisseminate started during the pandemic as a way to raise awareness about self-archiving. Over time, we felt proud of that work but also wanted to branch out and talk about other open science practices like sharing open data, preregistration, registered reports, open educational resources, and more. That‚Äôs what led to the creation of OpenCSD.\nBut, the truth is we‚Äôre all volunteers, doing this work as a side passion project. And in the past few years, life has been busy. Many of us have gone through big transitions‚Äîfinishing PhDs, starting postdocs or faculty roles, having babies‚Äîand we realized that trying to run two separate projects just didn‚Äôt make sense anymore.\nWe‚Äôre more effective (and have more fun) when we work together.\n\n\nSo what‚Äôs new?\nWe‚Äôre merging under the name CSDisseminate, with a fresh coat of purple paint and a renewed commitment to making open science more accessible in our field. We‚Äôll be tackling a broader range of topics moving forward‚Äîand first up is one we‚Äôre especially excited about: sharing open data.\nStay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
