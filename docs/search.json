To get started:\n\nWatching the Self-Archiving 101 workshop video (or attending a live Self-Archiving 101 workshop).\nTaking the self-assessment to see if there are any concepts you want to brush up on.\n\nThen:\n\nStarting to self-archive your own or your lab‚Äôs research.\n\nEarn a place as a featured scientist who self-archives on our site!\nEarn badges for self-archiving (coming soon)!\n\nPresenting a Self-Archiving 101 workshop at your institution.\n\nCustomize these slides & resources with information about your institution.\nPresent anywhere you like! During a seminar, course, lab meeting, or department meeting.\n\nBeing available to answer questions from your colleagues about the steps of self-archiving.\n\nUse our Forum (coming soon) to crowdsource answers to difficult or complicated questions.\n\nSharing social media posts from CSDisseminate to relevant social media groups or platforms.\n\n\nDoes my Institution need a CSDisseminate Ambassador? ‚Äã\nHere are some ideas to help you better understand if/how self-archiving is currently being done at your institution or within your organization:\nReview your institution‚Äôs lab web pages & see if/how they list their publications.\n\nAre articles recently updated with a full citation?\nAre articles linked to the doi?\nAre self-archived, free versions of manuscripts linked?\nAre they following appropriate guidelines re: which version is allowed to be posted?\n\nFind out if your institution has a repository for articles. Talk to your institution‚Äôs library/research dept to get a handle on how the institutional repository works.\n\nWho do you contact if you have an article to submit to the repository?\nWhat versions of articles will they accept?\nHow quickly are articles posted after submitting to the repository?\nAre you able to revise versions of articles submitted to the repository?\n\nAt most Universities, there‚Äôs quite a bit of variability in how much each lab or scientist participates in self-archiving.

Our mission is still the same: to spread the word about open science in communication sciences and disorders (CSD). But now we‚Äôre doing it together.\n\nWhy the merge?\nCSDisseminate started during the pandemic as a way to raise awareness about self-archiving. Over time, we felt proud of that work but also wanted to branch out and talk about other open science practices like sharing open data, preregistration, registered reports, open educational resources, and more. That‚Äôs what led to the creation of OpenCSD.\nBut, the truth is we‚Äôre all volunteers, doing this work as a side passion project. And in the past few years, life has been busy. Many of us have gone through big transitions‚Äîfinishing PhDs, starting postdocs or faculty roles, having babies‚Äîand we realized that trying to run two separate projects just didn‚Äôt make sense anymore.\nWe‚Äôre more effective (and have more fun) when we work together.\n\n\nSo what‚Äôs new?\nWe‚Äôre merging under the name CSDisseminate, with a fresh coat of purple paint and a renewed commitment to making open science more accessible in our field.
