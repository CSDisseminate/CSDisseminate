While self-archiving remains an important goal, we plan to expand our efforts to include additional open science practices such as data sharing and other forms of transparent research dissemination.\nAs an Ambassador, you will serve as a local resource, supporting your colleagues as they take meaningful steps toward making their research more accessible. To get started:\n\nWatching the Self-Archiving 101 workshop video (or attending a live Self-Archiving 101 workshop).\nTaking the self-assessment to see if there are any concepts you want to brush up on.\n\nThen:\n\nStarting to self-archive your own or your lab’s research.\n\nEarn a place as a featured scientist who self-archives on our site!\nEarn badges for self-archiving (coming soon)!\n\nPresenting a Self-Archiving 101 workshop at your institution.\n\nCustomize these slides & resources with information about your institution.\nPresent anywhere you like! During a seminar, course, lab meeting, or department meeting.\n\nBeing available to answer questions from your colleagues about the steps of self-archiving.\n\nUse our Forum (coming soon) to crowdsource answers to difficult or complicated questions.\n\nSharing social media posts from CSDisseminate to relevant social media groups or platforms.\n\n\nDoes my Institution need a CSDisseminate Ambassador? ​\nHere are some ideas to help you better understand if/how self-archiving is currently being done at your institution or within your organization:\nReview your institution’s lab web pages & see if/how they list their publications.\n\nAre articles recently updated with a full citation?\nAre articles linked to the doi?\nAre self-archived, free versions of manuscripts linked?\nAre they following appropriate guidelines re: which version is allowed to be posted?\n\nFind out if your institution has a repository for articles. Talk to your institution’s library/research dept to get a handle on how the institutional repository works.\n\nWho do you contact if you have an article to submit to the repository?\nWhat versions of articles will they accept?\nHow quickly are articles posted after submitting to the repository?\nAre you able to revise versions of articles submitted to the repository?\n\nAt most Universities, there’s quite a bit of variability in how much each lab or scientist participates in self-archiving. But having a point-person to discuss it with is helpful for pretty much everyone!\nThank you for considering being a self-archiving Ambassador. If interested, please contact csdisseminate@gmail.com."

Further, once manuscripts are linked on your website, they will also be indexed by Google, where others are more likely to discover your work.\nHere are 4 simple steps for creating a website that will get you started on your self-archiving journey. This approach is free and assumes no prior experience in website design/development.\n\n1. Choose a website builder\nWebsite builders make it possible to create and publish a website in minutes. They provide you with a bunch of templates that can be customized to fit your needs. Some free and easy-to-use options include Wix, Owlstown, Squarespace, Weebly, and Google Sites.\nIf you have some experience in coding, there are also some Advanced Options for website creation. For example, this website is created with R and Quarto and hosted via GitHub Pages.\n\n\n\n2. Add your information\nCreate an ‘About Me’ section where you include a short bio (name, affiliation, research interests) so that your audience knows they have found the right website.\nCreate a ‘Publications’ section where you list all of your publications.\nOptional extras: Recent and upcoming talks, courses taught, projects, blogposts, ‘in the news’, links to other sites (e.g., Google Scholar, ORCID), and social media accounts.\n\n\n3. Add your publications\nFor each publication, follow our self-archiving steps to determine what version can be linked.\n\n\n4.

But the URL can be broken, while the DOI can’t.\n\n\nLinking to the free version vs the article of record\nAlways, always, always link to your journal article with its DOI. That’s the only way you’ll be able to:\n\nShow people where the original is, and\nProperly measure traffic to it (e.g. via Altmetric).\n\nWe recommend that if you’re creating a professional website, your article be linked with the DOI, and the free (possibly “unofficial”) version be a separate link that says something like free version.\n\n\nWhat if I prefer for people to just email me instead?\nRequiring clinicians to email when they want a paper puts a barrier between the science and clinical practice.\nIt also makes the work of science communicators, who are trying to direct people to your work, much more difficult.\n\n\nHow will people find my uploaded articles?\nMost people will Google the title of your paper.

Our mission is still the same: to spread the word about open science in communication sciences and disorders (CSD). But now we’re doing it together.\n\nWhy the merge?\nCSDisseminate started during the pandemic as a way to raise awareness about self-archiving. Over time, we felt proud of that work but also wanted to branch out and talk about other open science practices like sharing open data, preregistration, registered reports, open educational resources, and more. That’s what led to the creation of OpenCSD.\nBut, the truth is we’re all volunteers, doing this work as a side passion project. And in the past few years, life has been busy. Many of us have gone through big transitions—finishing PhDs, starting postdocs or faculty roles, having babies—and we realized that trying to run two separate projects just didn’t make sense anymore.\nWe’re more effective (and have more fun) when we work together.\n\n\nSo what’s new?\nWe’re merging under the name CSDisseminate, with a fresh coat of purple paint and a renewed commitment to making open science more accessible in our field. We’ll be tackling a broader range of topics moving forward—and first up is one we’re especially excited about: sharing open data.\nStay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

We work towards this goal in two related lines of work. One has examined how working memory, language, and orthography may influence children’s abilities to learn new words, read, and achieve age-appropriate speech production. A related line of work has examined how speech therapy-level variables, such as SLPs’ stress, job satisfaction, therapy quality, and IEP goals, may impact the outcomes seen in children with speech and language impairments.\n\n\nVisit the Lab Website!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly Farquharson, PhD, CCC-SLP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceiving the OSSPEAC Award, a Clinical Achievement award, from Dr. Wayne Secord\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoster presentation with Katie Goodwin (lab undergrad) and Dr. Whitney Schneider-Cline, collaborator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
