long-description: "**Preregistration Essentials** is a comprehensive guide developed by the Center for Open Science to support researchers in adopting preregistration as a core open science practice. The resource explains how preregistration improves transparency, reduces bias, and strengthens research credibility by clearly distinguishing planned analyses from exploratory work. It includes best practices, examples, and tools for using the Open Science Framework (OSF), and addresses common challenges across research phases and disciplines. This user-friendly guide is especially useful for researchers, educators, and institutions aiming to integrate open, reproducible practices into their work.
