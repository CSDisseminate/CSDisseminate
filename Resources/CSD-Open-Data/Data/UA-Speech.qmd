title: "UA-Speech"
short-description: "The UA-Speech corpus was published in 2008. It originally contained recordings of nineteen individuals with dysarthria as a correlate of cerebral palsy, plus age-matched and gender-matched controls. Of the original nineteen, three have removed permission over the years, and/or their data has been corrupted, so that the distribution now contains data from sixteen speakers."
