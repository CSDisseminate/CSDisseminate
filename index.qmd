### ‚úÖ Preregistration

Preregistration is the practice of documenting and publicly sharing the research plan and hypotheses before conducting a study to increase transparency and reduce bias.

### üìê Open Methods

Open methods involve the transparent sharing of research methodologies, protocols, and processes, allowing others to replicate, verify, and build upon the original research.

### üíΩ Open Data

Open data refers to data that is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and share without restrictions, promoting transparency, innovation, and collaboration.

### üîì Open Access & Self-Archiving

Open access is the practice of providing unrestricted online access to scholarly research, allowing anyone to read, download, and share it freely.

### üçé Open Educational Resources

Open educational resources are freely accessible, openly licensed materials used for teaching and learning, allowing users to legally use, modify, and distribute them.

## Our Mission

**What:** We are a working group of researchers and clinicians dedicated to disseminating knowledge about open science practices to clinicians and researchers in Communication Sciences and Disorders (CSD) and beyond.

**Who:** We aim to educate a diverse group of partners‚Äîresearchers, speech-language pathologists, audiologists, students, administrators, policymakers, publishers, and community members‚Äîon resources and strategies that enhance the reproducibility, transparency, and accessibility of science in our discipline.

**Why:** When researchers and clinicians embrace open science practices, it:

1.  Increases transparency and reproducibility of research methods;

2.  Fosters interdisciplinary clinical research collaboration;

3.  Bridges the clinical and research gap in the CSD community by reducing barriers to accessing and understanding research.

**How:** Our organization promotes open science practices through various initiatives, including:

-   Sharing resources that aid in discovering openly available research materials and products;

-   Educating on methods for the management and sustainability of open science practices, including self-archiving, pre-registration, open data, and sharing materials;

-   Conducting research to explore the use and sustainability of various open science practices in our discipline;

-   Hosting initiatives such as ambassador programs, learning labs, podcasts, journal clubs, and workshops that empower researchers and clinicians to integrate open science practices into their work.

**Vision:** To advance the worldwide accessibility, reproducibility, and transparency of research, aiming to enhance speech, language, hearing, and swallowing for all people.
